# Canvas in TypeScript

[![ci](https://github.com/egilsster/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/egilsster/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Simple whiteboard application written in TypeScript and is built with Vite, TailwindCSS. Originally written during my
undergrad in Reykjavik University (used to be written in JavaScript and used jQuery, gulp and bootstrap) but I have
been playing with new technologies in this project for fun.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
