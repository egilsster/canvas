# Canvas in TypeScript

[![ci](https://github.com/egilsster/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/egilsster/canvas/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Simple whiteboard application written in TypeScript and uses Vite, jQuery and TailwindCSS. Originally written during my
undergrad in Reykjavik University (used to be written in JavaScript and used gulp and bootstrap) but I have been playing
with new technologies in this project for fun.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
