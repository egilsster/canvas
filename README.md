# Canvas

Vanilla canvas application written in TypeScript and is built with Vite, TailwindCSS. Originally written during my
undergrad in Reykjavik University (used to be written in JavaScript and used jQuery, gulp and bootstrap) but I have
been playing with new technologies in this project for fun.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
